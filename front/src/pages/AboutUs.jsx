          <p>
            Our gallery&apos;s story unfolds from a tapestry woven with threads
            of disorder and the ordinary, against which the vision for our space
            stood out starklyâ€”a beacon of calm. It is said that an ethereal
            Buddha, in the stillness of a dream, whispered, &quot;Create a
            sanctuary, and tranquility will follow.&quot; Heeding this celestial
            advice, our journey began. The Buddha World Gallery was born from a
            collective of impassioned art aficionados, united by a reverence for
            the serene aesthetics of Buddhist tradition. From our humble
            beginnings, we have evolved into a distinguished haven, showcasing
            an eclectic collection of Buddhist art from every corner of the
            globe.
